            <p>Tai chi is an ancient Chinese tradition that, today, is practiced as a graceful form of exercise. It
                involves a series
                of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing.</p>
            <p>There are five different styles of tai chi, dating from different periods in history. Each has a unique
                set of methods
                and principles, lineage, and date of origin.
